This type of coffee is made from coffee beans ground using pressurized water.\r \rHere are the general steps in making an espresso:\rBean Selection and Grinding:\r \rTo make a quality espresso, fresh coffee beans should be selected and ground just before use. Finely ground coffee is usually used.\r \rDosage: About 7 to 9 grams of coffee is usually used for a standard espresso shot.\r \rPressing (Tamping): The ground coffee is placed in the portafilter of the espresso machine and compressed (pressed) using a special tool. This step ensures that the coffee comes out homogeneously under the pressure of the water.\r \rUsing the Espresso Machine:\r \rThe portafilter is placed in the espresso machine and water is passed through the beans under high pressure. This results in a dense, aromatic coffee in a short time.\r \rExtraction:\r \rEspresso is usually extracted over a period of between 25 and 30 seconds. This time can vary depending on the type of bean, the degree of grinding and the machine used.\r \rIn conclusion, espresso is a type of coffee with a small volume, an intense flavor profile and is usually drunk in a single sip. It is also used as a base ingredient in many coffee drinks, such as cappuccino and latte.",
